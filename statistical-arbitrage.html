            <h3>The Motivation: From Biomedical Signals to Market Signals</h3>
            <p>As a recent Biomedical Engineering graduate, my background is in analyzing complex, often noisy, time-series data like ECG and EEG signals to find meaningful patterns. I became fascinated with quantitative finance because it presents a similar challenge: extracting predictive signals from the apparent noise of financial markets.</p>
            <p>This project was my hands-on dive into this world. I wanted to see if I could apply the same rigorous, data-driven mindset I developed in engineering to build a complete algorithmic trading strategy from the ground up. I chose pairs trading because it's a classic statistical arbitrage strategy that perfectly blends statistics, time-series analysis, and programming.</p>

            <h3>The Engine: A Technical Breakdown</h3>
            <p>I structured the project as a single Python class, <code>PairsTradingBacktester</code>, to keep the logic organized and reusable. The engine's workflow can be broken down into four main steps: Data Fetching, Signal Calculation, Backtesting, and Analysis.</p>
            
            <h3>Signal Calculation</h3>
            <p>This is the core of the strategy. Instead of trading the stocks directly, the strategy trades their <strong>spread</strong> (Price of Stock 1 - Price of Stock 2). The assumption is that this spread will tend to revert to its historical mean. To identify trading opportunities, I used Bollinger Bands and the Z-Score:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Spread:</strong> The simple difference between the pair's prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Moving Average:</strong> The historical mean of the spread over a 20-day lookback period.</li>
                <li><strong>Z-Score:</strong> This normalizes the spread, telling us exactly how many standard deviations it is from the mean. A Z-Score of +2.0 or -2.0 is my signal to enter a trade.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Backtesting the Logic</h3>
            <p>The backtesting method iterates through the historical data day-by-day, simulating trades based on the Z-Score:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Entry Signal:</strong> If not in a trade, a position is opened when the Z-Score exceeds +/- 2.0. If the spread is unusually high (Z > +2.0), the engine shorts the spread. If it's unusually low (Z < -2.0), it longs the spread.</li>
                <li><strong>Exit Signal:</strong> The position is closed when the Z-Score reverts back to its mean (Z-Score = 0), capturing the profit from the mean-reversion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Key Learnings & Next Steps</h3>
            <p>This project was a fantastic learning experience that solidified my interest in quantitative finance. It was a practical application of statistics and Python programming to solve a real-world analytical problem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Skills Demonstrated:</strong> Quantitative Analysis, Python, Pandas, Time-Series Manipulation, Algorithmic Thinking, Data Visualization.</li>
                <li><strong>Future Improvements:</strong> For a more robust version, I would explore using cointegration tests (like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) for pair selection and incorporate transaction costs for a more realistic backtest.</li>
            </ul>
